# Encryption-Decryption-Program
(2016)
This is a Encryption & Decryption program developped in Microsoft Studio using C#

This program turns your sentence into a mixed alphabet combined with numbers and signs.
It generates different mixed alphabet every time the encryption starts. This way the encrypted version of the text cannot be solved without the decryption part of the program. 
Decryption part transforms the encrypted text into the normal text.
